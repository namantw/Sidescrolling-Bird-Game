# Sidescrolling-Bird-Game

![](https://image.ibb.co/jCdjSG/Banner.png)

A flappy bird style game made with Unity ðŸ˜‰

This is a short, experimental cross-platform (Android and PC) game made from scratch. All scripts were made by me (took hours of digging in the documentations). Feel free to use the C# Scripts in your own project. The game has only two unity scenes which can be found in `Assets/Scenes`. All the sprites and music used in the game are royalty-free. The links to the free game assets used in this game are given below.
